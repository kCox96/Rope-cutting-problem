This project is a university assignment which implements a variation of the Bin Packing Problem, called the Rope Cutting Problem.

"A sports store sells climbing rope. The store buys rope in coils of varying lengths from the manufacturer, and then cuts them according to customer orders."

The problem is to minimise the number of coils of rope supplied by the manufacturer that would be needed to satisfy all cutomer orders. In order to solve this problem, I have implemented the next fit and first fit algorithms.  

This assignment was designed to:
- assesss my ability to develop new algorithms.
- strengthen my understanding of greedy algorithms.
- provide experience of evaluating and comparing different algorithms.
